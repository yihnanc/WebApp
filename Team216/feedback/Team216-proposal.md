 * Displaying all nearby events is an interesting concept, but I would encourage you to focus your project idea. Try to narrow down your application to events that go well with location tracking - travel records, as you mentioned, lend themselves better to a map view than meeting notes.

 * This seems like a nice idea, but I think it is a bit too broad right now. I would focus on one aspect that you really want to sell with the webapp, and not include things like restaurant information, since it would probably clutter your page in a harmful way (you're trying to make this an event based app). This seems very heavily dependent on Google Maps right now and not much else, so you might be abe to add other functionalities with other API's such as text message notification when a new event spawns near you, etc.

 * I like the idea of this app. I think you'll be leveraging map APIs heavily. You should try to see if there are any other Map-based APIs out there (not just Google's) that could be useful. For example, maybe there's a real-time alerts based API which gives locations of crime incidents. This might be useful in your app.
