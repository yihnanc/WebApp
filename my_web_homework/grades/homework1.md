Homework 1 Feedback

Commit graded: 07d2f71a70806fe291d715b0703e390aa2dd28bc


### Grumblr design process (8/10)

  * -2, Your wireframes do not correspond well with your final design. For example, your login and registration pages do not reflect your wireframe design.    

### Demonstrates basic familiarity with HTML and CSS

#### Completeness: Solution meets basic specification (15/15)

  * -0, In your registration form, you might want to add a “confirm password” field to prevent users from mistyping their initial password.  
  * -0, Consider adding a link to the logged-in user's profile page from the follower stream.  

#### Demonstrates understanding of HTML/CSS (7/15)

  * -3, You should avoid in-line styling (e.g. `style="..."` in tags) when possible. Using CSS rules instead will make it easier to find and apply styling changes to your pages.  
  * -1, `<title>` tags for each page should contain a short textual description of what page the user is actually on. For instance, a login page could be title ‘Login’.  
  * -0.1, Ideally you should indent your HTML code so that nested tags are one indentation level further than their parents, as this will improve readability of your code.  
  * -0.1, `<p>` HTML tag used for the wrong purpose. There are places where you have `<p></p>`. If spacing is what you are trying to achieve, try to do this through CSS or bootstrap divs.  
  * -0, In the real world it's normal to cite an external resource in a comment where you use it, but for this course it's slightly easier for us if you cite all your external resources in the homework's README file.  
  * -4, Grumblr pages should share a common look and feel. This can be accomplished by using CSS stylesheets, either your own or with a CSS templating library like Bootstrap (or a mix of both).  
  * -0.1, There are validation errors in your grumblr CSS.  High-quality CSS should always be validated using [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/] to ensure that it meets the CSS standards.  
  * -0.1, There are validation errors in your grumblr HTML.  High-quality HTML should always be validated using [https://validator.w3.org/] to ensure that it meets the HTML standards.  


### Appropriate use of course infrastructure and Git (7/10)

  * -3, Ideally you should create separate commits (with detailed commit messages) for each independent change you make as you work.  For this assignment even the most slight use of version control should include at least two incremental commits: one for the design feedback and wireframe diagrams and one for the Grumblr implementation.  Because the design process and Grumblr implementation include many independent changes, a truly effective use of version control would contain many additional commits for each independent change.  

### Additional feedback

  * -0, Your citations should link to the resources you used instead of just saying that they came from Bootstrap.  
  * -0, Your login and registration pages are hard to read. Perhaps consider removing transparency.  
  * -0, Resources should have valid targets. For example, `<script src="../../dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>`. You can check for resources which failed to load in the Chrome developer console.  
  * -0.1, Your CSS file has `//` for comments. This is not valid commenting in CSS.  
  * -0, When you have meta tags for description and author, you should fill in the content.
