I have discussed with TA Rohan Jadvani about my wireframes

He told me that I should keep my wireframe simple and eliminate extra design outside the scope of this homework

Furthermore, he recommend me to seperate my register page and log in page. 

I use pen to delete the unnecessary part and took a photo as revised version
