1.I use POST method to transmit my HTTP request, which prevents some users directly modify the request manualy without clicking the button by appending invalid request in URL

2.For designing the configuration of my calculator, I review the following website as my color settin:

3. Based on the property of python, I didn't handle the case such as -2/6 = -1 since if you type -2/6 in the interpreter of python, it also shows -1

5. Support negative input as the first number, you also can click different times of "-" before click any number
    ex: if you type --1, then it means 1, ---1 means -1
6. Support error handle for invalid request(x/0 or non single digit or operator)
